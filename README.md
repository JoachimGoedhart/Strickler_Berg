# Strickler_Berg

The extinction coefficient of a fluorophore can be estimated from the Strickler-Berg equation ([Strickler and Berg, 1962](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1733166))

The R-script EC_by_Strickler-Berg.R demonstrates the calculation of the EC of mTurquoise2 based on these spectroscopic data:

* Absorbance/emission spectra, taken from the file 'mTurquoise2_spectra.csv' 
* Quantum Yield: 0.93
* Fluorescence lifetime: 4 [ns]
